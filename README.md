# Super-Soccer-Game
An interesting soccer game made by Pygame

## Version
Now is local version, since implementation of online version is way too
time-consuming and unstable.

## Rule
There are 2 teams.

| Team 0 | Team 1 |
| :----: | :----: |
|blue|red|
|right door| left door |

The boundary is reflective for ball. And player can't pass the boundary.

After any team get a goal, game will reset.

After a player just get/steal the ball, other player need to wait for few seconds to steal its ball.

After a player just shoot the ball, the player need to wait for few seconds to be able to get/steal the ball again.

## TODO
1. RL
2. add args to decide (if-train, player-number, FPS)
